Idea 1: Bird Call ID
- Predict the species of a bird given their bird call via an mp3
- I want to create a deep and wide neural net to predict the species of a bird.  I did some research and tensorflow can read in audio data and get out the waveform.  I believe this is a multiclassification problem so if that gets too difficult I will try to predict whether it is one species of bird or not.
